There should be no necessary installations here apart from the imported libraries in the first cell of code.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
---

This project is one of the capstone projects available in Udacity Data Science nanodegree program. I chose this project since it focuses on a very interesting aspect which is the impact of different kind of offers on customers behavior. The data set availed by Udacity contains simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offer during certain weeks. Not all users receive the same offer, and every offer has a validity period before the offer expires. Offers might be viewed or not, and completed or not. The offer is completed when its requirements are met before the end of the offer duration. 
The data set is availed in three json files:
portfolio.json - containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.)
profile.json - demographic data for each customer
transcript.json - records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed
It is worth noting that the offers we have here in the data set and hence this project is for only one kind of product to simplify the analysis in this project. In real life, multiple kinds of offers and multiple kinds of products will add more complexity to the task. 


What are we doing with this data:
The main goal of this project is to figure out to some extent how customers react to different offer types. I will also have an attempt at trying to estimate if a customer would react to a particular offer or not. The methodology to achieve those goals would be as follows:
Data Exploration - investigate the data sets and perform analysis on existing data
Data Processing- clean and process the data so that it is ready for analysis
Data Analysis - analyze the cleaned data and identify patterns
Data Modelling - attempt to create a model to predict if customer would view and complete an offer


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  The notebooks is self explonatory as you can see comments and descirption of each step in the notebook. 

The data folder conatins the data used in the notebook


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here]().
